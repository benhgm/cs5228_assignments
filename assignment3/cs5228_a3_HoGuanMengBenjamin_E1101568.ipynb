    "Hello everyone, this assignment notebook covers Tree-Based Models. There are some code-completion tasks and question-answering tasks in this answer sheet. For code completion tasks, please write down your answer (i.e., your lines of code) between sentences that \"Your code starts here\" and \"Your code ends here\". The space between these two lines does not reflect the required or expected lines of code. For answers in plain text, you can refer to [this Markdown guide](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/the-ultimate-markdown-guide-for-jupyter-notebook-d5e5abf728fd) to customize the layout (although it shouldn't be needed).\n",

Also, in the bagging only model, since we are using more features, we can always choose the best split among the 4 features for each split, and allowing us to arrive at the leaf faster. On the other hand, since there are only two features to select from in the bagging + feature sampling model, more splits will be required to arrive at the leaf.\n"

    "## 2 Implementing a AdaBoost with Decision Stumps (30 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is an ensemble learning method that combines the predictions of multiple base learners to improve overall classification performance. In AdaBoost, the base learners are typically weak learners, which are models that perform slightly better than random guessing (e.g., Decision Stumps). Here's a brief overview of how AdaBoost works using Decision Trees as base learners for classification tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Initialization:** Assign equal weights to all training samples. These weights determine the importance of each sample in the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Iterative Phase:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * *Base Learner Training:* Train a base learner (usually a Decision Stump) on the training data. It tries to minimize the weighted classification error, giving more weight to misclassified samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * *Weighted Error Calculation:* Calculate the weighted classification error of the base learner. This error is the sum of the weights of misclassified samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * *Classifier Weight Calculation:* Assign a weight to the base learner based on its performance. The better the performance, the higher the weight. This weight is used to determine the contribution of the base learner's prediction in the final ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * *Update Sample Weights:* Increase the weights of misclassified samples so that they become more important in the next iteration. This focuses the subsequent base learners on the samples that are harder to classify correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * *Ensemble Building:* Combine the predictions of all base learners, weighted by their individual classifier weights, to obtain the final ensemble prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Final Prediction:** The final prediction is made by aggregating the weighted predictions of all base learners.\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost's strength lies in its ability to focus on the difficult-to-classify examples, allowing it to improve performance even with weak base learners. This makes it particularly effective in situations where a single base learner might struggle. Keep in mind that while AdaBoost is powerful, it's important to be cautious about overfitting. AdaBoost can overfit if the base learners are too complex or if the number of iterations is too high. Therefore, it's advisable to monitor the performance on a validation set and potentially use techniques like early stopping or limiting the complexity of base learners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your last task will be to implement an AdaBoost Classifier using Decision Stumps as covered in the lecture. But not to worry, this may only sound more difficult than it actually is, and we will guide you through this process step by step. We also keep things simple by assuming that all input features are numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, we can split the implementation into 2 subtasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Weak Learner:** You first implement the simplest \"Decision Stump Classifier\", i.e., a Decision Tree with only one split and therefore a height of 1. This means we do not have to care about the recursive splitting of nodes; it's not complicated but would only add tedious coding.\n",
    "* **AdaBoost:** With the Decision Stump Classifier in place, you can implement AdaBoost as shown in the lecture."

This process is repeated K times, with each fold used as the test set exactly once. The final performance metric is computed by averaging the results from each iteration.

    "\n",
    "Run the k-fold cross validation for all 3 regressors and compare and discuss the results! You should see quite a number of differences regarding runtimes, issues of overfitting and underfitting, overall performance, effects of parameter values, etc. You can use the code cells above for cross validation and visualization.\n",

    "### Runtime\n",
    "Recorded runtimes:<br>\n",
    "- Decision Tree: 854ms<br>\n",
    "- Random Forest: 54.9s<br>\n",
    "- Gradient Boost: 1min 20s\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown above, in terms of runtime, the decision tree was the fastest and the slowest was the gradient boosting method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overfitting Issue\n",
    "Both the decision tree and the gradient boosting methods were prone to overfitting, as can be observed by the training score approaching zero, while the validation score increased as the training score went down. On the other hand, the random forest model saw both training and validation scores progressing in the same directions throughout the training, which suggests that the model may not have overfitted as much as the other two models yet. The random forest model also has a slightly higher training loss which is expected since feature sampling and bagging is used to ensure that each tree in the forest does not overfit to the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Score Variance\n",
    "Comparing the variance of the RMSE scores of the K-fold cross validation models, we can observe that the gradient boost model has significantly higher variance over the 10-folds while the random forest model has a lower variance in RMSE scores. The lower variance in random forest could be attributed to the fact that strong predictors are not likely to be present in all the trees. This allows a balanced prediction outcome across each fold.\n"

    "Since all three models gave relatively similar results in terms of the final RMSE score (between 2.75 and 4.0), it is difficult to conclude which regressor is the best regressor to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the decision tre and gradient boost models displayed signs of overfitting, the final RMSE scores were still close to that of the random forest, which means that they could still give quite good predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps a good way is to combine three regressors and find the mean of the prediction, or use a majority voting system to get a final prediction. This is assuming space complexity and runtime requirements of any potential solution is not an issue."

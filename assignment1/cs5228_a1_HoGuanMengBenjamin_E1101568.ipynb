    "# CS5228 Assignment 1 - EDA, Data Preparation & K-Means\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello everyone, this assignment notebook covers EDA, Data Preparation & K-Means. There are some code-completion tasks and question-answering tasks in this answer sheet. For code completion tasks, please write down your answer (i.e., your lines of code) between sentences that \"Your code starts here\" and \"Your code ends here\". The space between these two lines does not reflect the required or expected lines of code. For answers in plain text, you can refer to [this Markdown guide](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/the-ultimate-markdown-guide-for-jupyter-notebook-d5e5abf728fd) to customize the layout (although it shouldn't be needed).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you work on this notebook, you can insert additional code cells (e.g., for testing) or markdown cells (e.g., to keep track of your thoughts). However, before the submission, please remove all those additional cells again. Thanks!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:**\n",
    "* Rename and save this Jupyter notebook as **cs5228_a1_YourName_YourNUSNETID.ipynb** (e.g., **cs5228_a1_BobSmith_e12345678.ipynb**) before submission!\n",
    "* Rename and save the script file *cs5228_a1_script.py* as **cs5228_a1_YourName_YourNUSNETID.py** (e.g., **cs5228_a1_BobSmith_e12345678.py**) before submission!\n",
    "* Submission deadline is **Thursday, Sep 14, 11.59 pm**. Late submissions will be penalized by 10% for each additional day. Failure to appropriately rename both files will yield a penalty of 1 Point. There is no need to use your full name if it's rather long; it's just  important to easily identify you in Canvas etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please also add your NUSNET and student id in the code cell below. This is just to make any identification of your notebook doubly sure."

    "### Issues with dataset\n",
    "#### 1. Duplicated Data Points (Done)\n",
    "By using `df_cars_dirty[\"listing_id\"].unique()`, we can see that there are only **14,321 unique listing ids**, which means that **there are duplicated listings in the dataset**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Duplicated Listing IDs with Inconsistent Data\n",
    "When `df_cars_dirty.drop_duplicates()` is used to drop the duplicated data points and `df_cars_dirty[\"listing_id\"].unique()` is run again, we should expect that the number of unique listing ids remain at 14,321 and the length of the dataset should be 14,321 also. Since theoretically, all duplicated listings should have been removed. This is however not the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon inspection of the remaining dataset, we will find that there are now **14,344** data points. This implies that there are still some duplicated listing IDs in the dataset. By checking the number of times each of the listing ids in the remaining dataset appears and counting only those that appear more than once, we get a count of **23** which is exactly the discrepancy we expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon inspection of these data points more closely, we can realise that these are data points where there are some **erroneous and inconsistent values**. For example, the listing id \"1001655\" appears twice in in line 3393 and line 9459. There is an error in the manufacture date in line 3393 which states \"2119\", which is not a valid date at present. The correct data, on line 9459 is \"2019\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Same Vehicle Make Appears In Two Different Forms (Done)\n",
    "There are 3 entries in the dataset where the **_vehicle make is specified as \"mercedes\"_**, while the **_model is specified as \"benz\"_**. We shall not remove these data points because of this discrepancy. Instead, we can **_correct the mistakes in the column values_**. First, the **_\"make\" will be corrected to \"mercedes-benz\"_**. Next, to find out the \"model\" of these 3 cars, we **_compare the other specs, such as manufactured date, type of vehicle, power, engine capacity and curb weight with data from the other \"mercedes-benz\" data points._** Together with a **_simple google search_** on the specs of these 3 unknown vehicles, we can identify the **_missing \"model\" labels to be \"a200\" and \"a180\"._**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Dirty \"curb_weight\" Data (Done)\n",
    "There are two issues with \"curb_weight\" data.\n",
    "a) The \"curb_weight\" column contains 280 \"XXXXX\" values. We can find the correct curb weight value for the particular model by matching the other vehicle specifications with other listings. However, even after matching, there exists some vehicle models that have multiple valid curb weights. For example, toyota qashqai has curb weight variants of 1285 and 1325. For these cases, we will ignore the \"XXXXX\" values and remove them after. This amounts to 106 entries. We have managed to retain more than half the dirty data.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) The \"curb_weight\" column is in string format. As this data can be considered ratio data, we will convert all the \"curb_weight\" values into integer form.\n"

By plotting a histogram of mileage data grouped by the number of previous owners, we observe that \"mileage\" data is generally slightly positively skewed and it is observable that the mileage increases with number of owners. To account for this distrubution, we replace missing mileage data with the median mileage for each group of number of previous owners.\n",

    "1. The `eco_category` column only has one unique value throughout all the rows in the dataset, which is `'uncategorized'`. Since there is only one class in this feature, we are not able to make an analysis using `eco_category` as a feature that will determine the price of the car since all cars in the dataset, regardless of price will have the same `eco_category`. We will remove this column from the dataset.\n",
    "2. We now have two time-related columns - `manufactured` and `reg_date`. The `manufactured` data tells us how long since the car was produced, which gives an indication of its intrinsic value. However, `reg_date` indicates the time that it was purchased by the first owner. This is turn, tells us how long the car has actually been in use for. We can hypothesise that the difference between the `reg_date` and `manufactured` date reflects how 'new' the car is in terms of its first use, and hence may affect its current price. Using an example of two cars with similar specifications and popularity, a car manufactured earlier may be registered later than a car that was manufactured later but registered earlier. Therefore, the former is likely to be used less and may be in better condition, thus commanding a higher price. To generate the new feature, we convert the `reg_date`, which is a string object, to retain only it's year value in `YYYY` format and convert it to an integer value. Then, we take the difference between the year and `manufactured` to get a new feature `manufactured_to_reg`.\n",
    "3. There are a total of 526 unique car models in the dataset, of which the maximum count for occurrence of a unique class is for the amg model at 537, which accounts for only about 3% of the dataset. Additionally, there are 112 car models that only appear once in the dataset. To reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and make any resulting prediction model more generalizable, we can choose to remove the `model` column and only analyse ther cars based on their `make`. \n",
    "4. There are several instances of data that are factually incorrect. For example, checking the unique values of the `manufactured` date, we can identify several invalid entries, such as \"2111\", \"2115\", etc. We can give benefit of doubt and assume these are spelling errors and try to correct these data points. For example,  an entry of  '2111' could mean '2011'. We can try to use the information from the other columns, such as `make` and `model` for these invalid manufacturing years to try and deduce the correct manufacturing year. For those where similar data is not available, then we will omit the data.\n",
    "5. In the `type_of_vehicle` column, there are duplicated categories for mid-sized sedan (`mid-sized_sedan` and `mid-sized sedan`), sports car (`sports car` and `sports_car`) and luxury sedan (`luxury_sedan` and `luxury sedan`). To eliminate the duplicated categories, we will standardise all words to be separated by an underscore (\"_\") and replace dashes (\"-\") with an underscore also.\n",
    "6. In the vehicle `make` column, there is also the presence of same makes spelt differently. For example, we can find `'mercedes-benz'` and `'Mercedes'` entries and `'ssangyong'` and `'Ssangyong'` entries. Additionally, we also have the issue of using upper and lower casing causing extra unique values to appear. For example, `'Rolls-Royce'` and `'rolls-royce'` can be found in the dataset. To correct this, we identify all the different spellings of the same make and decide on the common one to use, then make sure that all entries are changed to only lowercase spelling. This will reduce the number of categories in this column and created bigger clusters for each vehicle make in the dataset that gives better representation for each vehicle make."

    "##### Additional Noise\n",
    "- Additional noise could come from the prices not reflecting their true value. When listing a car, some owners may price their vehicles much higher or lower than its actual value and resulting in data that may not be accurate. One way to check for such noisy data is to plot the distribution of prices for a particular set of features of cars. To eliminate the noisy data, ie. to remove any severely over-priced or under-price listings, we can set a threshold such as the data points where the price range lies between the 10th and 90th percentile and retain data within this threshold."

As such, assuming we indeed want to utilize them, we need to convert those attributes into numerical ones. Regarding encoding techniques, we covered [One-Hot Encoding](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html) in the lecture, and also talked about [Target Encoding](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/category_encoders/targetencoder.html) in the tutorial; you can and should also look into other encoding techniques.\n",

    "##### Vehicle Make\n",
    "There are 63 unique vehicle makes in the dataset, we will do label encoding for this data and randomly assign an integer value to each vehicle make. This will give us a value range of 0 to 62. In this case, label encoding is chose over one-hot encoding as it preserves the dimensionality of the dataset. Using one-hot encoding will cause the dataset to have additional 63 rows which could make the dataset dimensionality too large for analysis. Although it can be argued that assigning an integer may introduce some kind of biased ranking of the vehicles' importance or value, eg. vehicle make labelled as 0 may be misinterpreted as less valuable than a vehicle make labelled as 62 or vice-versa, we try to use random assignment of integers to reduce the probability of introducing bias.\n",

    "There are 10 unique vehicle attributes (ignoring the presence of duplicated categories mentioned in 1.3). In this case, we can perform one hot encoding by introducing 10 columns labelled 0 or 1 depending on whether the vehicle type corresponds to the column representing that type of vehicle. Since the number of categories is much lower now, one-hot encoding can be a feasible method to ensure that the encoding is fair without any notion of ranking.\n",

At the end of the process, data points are grouped into K clusters, with each cluster defined by its centroid. K-Means has applications across diverse fields, such as customer behavior analysis, image segmentation, and recommendation systems. However, it's sensitive to the initial centroid placement and assumes clusters are spherical and equally sized, which can affect its performance."

During this process, the method counts the number of times each data point (i.e., its index $0..14$) was picked for $c_2$, ..., $c_k$ (we use K=3 throughout this section). This gives you a distribution of how often a data point was selected as centroid, and plots it as a bar chart.

In contrast, DBSCAN has the notion of noise, i.e., points that are not part of any cluster, which can be used to identify outliers (see also Task 2). Now let's assume we want to identify outliers in a dataset but only have an implementation for K-Means available.\n",
